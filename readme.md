<strong>Sound Museum</strong> is a combo of music content and data-driven platform, its products include curated articles and user-generated content, customized data analytics dashboard. Both music lovers and creators are its targets. <br>

Based on its subscription model, I utilized Excel to calculate that how many users, how much time, how many conversation rates Sound Museum needs in order to get the breakeven point and further set project milestones. <br>

Also, key measurements were listed to project its business performance with a specific business goal and contribution margin. <br>

Lastly, according to risk rate = failure * occurrence (1-mitigation), I listed the risk mitigation tactics, higher possibility of product success and corresponding mitigation cost revealed.  <br>
